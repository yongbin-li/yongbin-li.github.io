Yongbin Li（李永彬）, graduated from Tsinghua University, senior staff algorithm expert of Alibaba DAMO Academy. My research direction is Conversational AI & NLP, such as **pre-trained conversation models, task-oriented dialogue, structural knowledge (TableQA, KBQA), unsutraucal、document-based question answering and multimodal dialogue**. In recent years, I have published a number of top conference papers, including ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, SIGIR, KDD, etc. At the same time, We have won the first place in many international leaderboards, for example, [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) / [SParC](https://yale-lily.github.io/sparc) / [CoSQL](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql) / [DialoGLUE](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/708/leaderboard) / [Commonsense QA 2.0](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/csqa2/submissions/public). As a co-founding member, I built Alibaba Cloud Intelligent Customer Service (阿里云智能客服，又称云小蜜), which has been **<font color="#dd0000">ranked NO.1</font>** in China's conversational AI cloud service market share since 2019.
